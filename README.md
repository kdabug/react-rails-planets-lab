Over the long weekend you'll be making a little baby rails app about PLANETS!!!! Gotta get those reps in!!! ðŸ’ªðŸ’ªðŸ’ª

## Resources

- Here's a [full CRUD react app](https://git.generalassemb.ly/wdi-nyc-thundercats/react-rails-monsters) to use as reference. 

- Here's some [planets data](planets.rb) that you can utilize to seed your database.

## TODO:

- `create-react-app` and `rails new`
- Be able to show all planets and show one planet.
- Start by making a Rails model and make 1 planet in the db with the rails console.
- Create your planet routes (`resources`).
- Implement index controller action.
- In the react FE create a view for showing all planets.
- Make an api call to get things from the rails server and display it.
- Make a second planet from the console.
- Write a show controller action and associated react components.
- Write a delete conroller action.
- Implement delete functionality in React (a delete planet button that calls delete fetch request).
- Write a create action and a create form in react. Wire it up.
- write an update action and edit form in react. Wire it up.

## Bonus

- Be able to show one random planet.

## Deliverable/Submission

You will be creating a new repo for this homework. You do not have to fork and clone this one. Create an issue ticket on this repo with a link to your repo containing your full stack react/rails planets app.
