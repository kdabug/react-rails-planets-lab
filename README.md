Tonight you'll be making a little baby rails app about PLANETS!!!! Gotta get those reps in!!! ðŸ’ªðŸ’ªðŸ’ª

## Resources

- Here's a [full CRUD react app]() to use as reference. It only works if you actually look at it though. 

- Here's some [planets data](planets.rb) that you can utilize to seed your database

## TODO:

- `create-react-app` and `rails new`
- be able to show all planets, show one
- start by making Rails model + make 1 planet in the db with the rails console
- create your planet routes (`resources`)
- implement index controller action
- make react FE with a view for showing all planets
- make api call to get things from the rails server and display it
- make a second planet from the console
- write a show controller action and associated react components
- write a delete conroller action
- implement delete functionality in React (delete button that calls delete fetch request)
- write a create action and a create form in react
- write an update action and edit form in react
- wire it all up

## Bonus

- be able to show one random planet

## Deliverable

You will be creating a new repo for this homework. You do not have to fork and clone this one. Create an issue ticket on this repo with a link to your repo containing your full stack react/rails planets app.
