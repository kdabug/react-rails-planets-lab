Tonight you'll be making a little baby rails app about PLANETS!!!! It'll be super similar to today's Compliments app lab. Gotta get those reps in!!! ðŸ’ªðŸ’ªðŸ’ª

[Here is your planet object!](./planets.rb) Use it wisely...

You'll be creating a bunch of routes & views using this object!

- `/`: Should have a welcome message and a link to the planets page
- `/planets`: Has a list of all the planets! (Don't hardcode this list! Just use the object. [Maybe one of our ruby methods could help...](https://ruby-doc.org/core-2.4.2/Hash.html#method-i-each))
- `/planets/:planet`: Returns information about that specific planet
- `/planets/random`: Returns a random planet


TODO:

- `create-react-app` and `rails new`
- be able to show all planets, show one + show. random one
- start by making Rails model + make 1 planet in the db with the rails console
- implement index route + controller action
- make react FE with a view for showing all planets
- make api call to get things from the rails server and display it
- make a second planet from the console
- write show route/controller action and associated react components
- write a create route/action and a create form in react
- wire it all up oh god
